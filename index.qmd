title: "Tutorials for G3RT"
---

Welcome to G3RT tutorials! These are a set of tutorials that are meant to **slowly** guide new users into working with the G3RT toolkit, explaining important concepts on the way. No prior knowledge of either G3RT or Julia (the programming language in which G3RT is written in) are required, however basic knowledge of atmospheric retrievals will help to better understand the material. Given Julia's current reach, there are also some mini-lessons inside the various tutorials when some Julia-related behavior is of crucial importance to the workings of G3RT routines or designs.

We recommend prospective users to start with this set of tutorials to get a good idea of how to work with G3RT, since some of the intended use patterns might run contrary to software packages they have used before. One of the main features of G3RT is that it **does not provide an explicit forward model** - as per the design philosophy of this toolset, we want users to be able to better control the flow of data from their sources into their new retrieval algorithm that they build with G3RT. Obviously, many of the main moving parts will be taken care of by G3RT, users will not have to re-invent the wheel necessarily. Two algorithms built with G3RT with the same conceptual ideas will likely produce very similar results. However, users must still write an explicit forward model that is called by one of the G3RT solvers. New users will not have to start from scratch, however. Aside from the tutorials, several example implementations of varying degrees of difficult exists that can guide them to achieve their goals!
